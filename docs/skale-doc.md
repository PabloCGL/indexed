## Type
Elastic sidechain network connected to Ethereum L1 through BLS Rollups. Allows deploying "Ethereum-as-a-Service" EVM-compatible blockchains through rental of node space on mainnet. The framework itself is PoS.

## Tx Cost
Gasless for under a specific usage threshold, small increase once over the threshold to fend off DDoS attacks. Threshold is set by sidechain size.

## Finality
Finalization times depend on sidechain size and configuration, but generally sub-second.

## Consensus
Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement.

## $ Efficient
Very efficient since you can adapt the sidechain size to developer needs. New applications can start with small and economic sidechain sizes and then grow together with their userbase.

## Max TPS
Up to 2000tps.
